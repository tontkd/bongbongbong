Most probably, MS SQL Server limitations specified in your PHP
configuration are too small. Increase the following values in your
php.ini:
<br><br>

; Valid range 0 - 2147483647.  Default = 4096.
<br>mssql.textlimit = 99999999

<br><br>
; Valid range 0 - 2147483647.  Default = 4096.
<br>mssql.textsize = 99999999

<br><br>
After editing the PHP configuration file, you will probably
need to restart your webserver. Check your server manual to find out
how to do that.
<br><br>
Please note, these changes won't affect messages which are already 
stored in the database, it will affect new messages only.
	<br>

	<a name="2" class="wmh_txt"><b>2. Fatal error: Allowed memory size of [###] bytes exhausted (tried to allocate [###] bytes) in [path]/[file].php on line [###]</b></a><br>
	<br>
This error caused by limitation of memory available for PHP script.
<br><br>
Increase the PHP configuration setting memory_limit (see the [PHP
manual]). After editing the PHP configuration file, you will probably
need to restart your webserver. Check your server manual to find out
how to do that.
<br><br>
You should add the following line (or change existing) into your php.ini file:
<br><br>
memory_limit = 60M
<br><br>
We recommend you to specify not lesser than 50M because large messages require additional memory for processing.

<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="3" class="wmh_txt"><b>3. Administration settings disappeared. Why?</b></a><br>
	<br>
First, make sure the correct path to the WebMail data folder is
specified in inc_settings_path.php file.
<br><br>
Common reason of settings not being saved is read-only permission to
the WebMail data folder or its contents. Check whether Internet Guest Account (or Apache user for Unix/Linux platform) has "write" permission over the data folder and all its contents.	<br>
</p><br>

<p class="wmh_reg">
	<a name="4" class="wmh_txt"><b>4. Error while attaching files to messages. Please advice.</b></a><br>
	<br>
Common problem with attachments is insufficient permissions for
attachments folder ("Path For Upload Attachments" defined in
Administration panel). IIS anonymous user must have "Full Control"
permission to this folder.
<br><br>
Also, if you are using IIS 6, size of a file that can be uploaded onto
the server is limited to 200K by default. You can increase this limit
according to you needs. To do this, type "notepad
%WINDIR%\system32\inetsrv\MetaBase.xml" in command line, search for
the "AspMaxRequestEntityAllowed" property, and specify necessary size
in bytes, then save this file. Please note, "Enable Direct Metabase
Edit" must be turned on, in other case, you will not be able to edit
this file. To check this option, look at your host properties in
Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
<br><br>
Also, attachments size may be limited in PHP configuration. Open
your php.ini file and locate the following lines:
<br><br>
upload_max_filesize = 2M
<br>
post_max_size = 8M
<br><br>
You should set these limits according to your needs,
but post_max_size should be equal to at least upload_max_filesize * 2.

	<br>
	MailBee WebMail provides this functionality itself ("home made"). Unfortunately, POP3 protocol itself does not
	support read/unread status. MailBee WebMail Pro system uses database where IDs of messages are stored.<br>
	<br>
	However, some POP3 servers append "Status" header to the each message. This header
	can take 2 values - "R" for Read and "U" for Unread. 
	But this method is not reliable because many popular servers do not support it.<br>
